ROM dumps and other information for my version of the 8 bit computer
all ROM's are 28c16's

I have included the instruction set, and copies of the ROM's used in my machine, I have made schematics and PCB layouts, keep an eye out for the changes as there are some mistakes on those, I need to update the github with the new schematics with corrections
